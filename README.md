# Tic-Tac-Toe
Java Projects <hr>
Here is a simple game of Tic-tac-toe.
We create a grid of 3 by 3 in this thereby, making 9 empty positions (1-9) for putting 0 or X.
The user has to choose a number between 1-9 which will decide the place of 'X' in the grid.
The compiler automatically generates a random number between 1-9 and fills 'O' in any other place .
The result is shown as soon as a side wins or a match is drawn.
