# Tic-Tac-Toe
Java Projects
Here is a simple game of Tic-tac-toe.
The user has to choose a number between 1-9 which will decide the place of 'X' in the grid.
The cpu automatically generates a random number between 1-9 and fills 'O' in any other place.
The result is shown as soon as a side wins or a match is drawn.
